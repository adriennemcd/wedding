						<h3>When</h3>
						<p>October 21st, 2017<br />
						4:00pm - 9:00pm</p>
						<h3>Where</h3>
						<p>Awbury Arboretum<br />
							<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1LSbGbWnGBE2" target="_blank">1 Awbury Rd, Philadelphia, PA 19138</a>
						</p>
						<p>If the weather cooperates, we will have access to Awbury's lovely grounds.  <a href="http://awbury.org/" target="_blank">Learn more about Awbury here.</a> The ceremony will be outside and the reception will be under a tent, so please dress comfortably! Some of Awbury's grounds are grass, some are woodchips, and the tent will be on stone pavers. 
						</p>
						<h3>Hotel</h3>
						<p>Possibly due to a <a href="http://www.visitphilly.com/events/philadelphia/harry-potter-weekend-in-chestnut-hill/" target="_blank">Harry Potter festival</a>, the nearby hotels couldn't offer us a block of rooms. We've been told that the hotels on City Ave are already full. May we suggest Airbnb? There are still plenty of homes and private rooms available in the surrounding neighborhoods.  Or if you planning on doing some Philly exploring, check out hotels in Center City!</p>
						<p>Reach out and let us know if you're feeling stuck and need help!</p>
						<h3>Wait, the wedding ends at 9pm?</h3>
						<p>Yes, yes it does.  Awbury is in a residential area, and out of respect for the neighbors, the wedding must end at 9. We've rented a beautiful house as an airbnb and you're welcome to join us for a fireside hangout afterwards. </p>
						<h3>Directions</h3>
						<p>Google is better at this than us (see the link in the 'Where' section), but here's a bit more detail for when you actually get here.  You can get to Awbury easily by car, bus, or train.</p>
						<p>Once at the entrance to Awbury, walking to Cope House takes about 5 to 10 minutes, and you are welcome to do so if you'd like! However, we will also have a shuttle service that you can use, located in the nearby Washington Lane train station parking lot.  More details on that in the 'Parking/Shuttle' section.</p>
 						<p><strong>Bus:</strong> SEPTA bus routes 18 and 26 stop on Chew Ave. and the XH bus stops on Washington Lane.<br />
						<strong>Train:</strong> the Station Rd. entrance to the Arboretum is directly across from Washington Lane Station on SEPTAâ€™s Chestnut Hill East Line.<br />
						<strong>Rideshare (Lyft, Uber, etc):</strong> Enter Awbury at the main entrance on Chew Ave. and bear left at the fork.  Soon you'll reach the parking attendant at the Station Rd. junction. You will be dropped off at this point; it's a short walk up to Cope House from there.</p>
						<h3>Parking/Shuttle</h3>
						<p>There are three options for parking in and around Awbury: Station Rd (15 spots), the SEPTA Washington Lane train station parking lot, and street parking (we recommend Washington Lane or Chew Avenue). Please click on the image below to see a map of Awbury with parking options.<br><br>
						<a href="Static/assets/images/awbury-map.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="Static/assets/images/awbury-map.png"></a>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Parking</strong><br />
						To see if any of the Station Rd. spots are available, please enter Awbury at the main entrance on Chew Ave. and bear left at the fork.  You'll reach the parking attendant at the Station Rd. junction, who will either direct you to a spot on Station Rd., or down to the train station parking lot. If both of those options are full, there should be plenty of street parking along Washington Lane and Chew Avenue.</p>
						<p><strong>Walking or Shuttle</strong><br />
						Once you park, you have the option of walking up to Cope house or taking a shuttle. If you plan to walk, you can enter Awbury at the Station Rd. entrance (located in the Washington Lane train station parking lot) or at Awbury's main entrance on Chew Ave., whichever is closest.  Just be aware on Station Rd. that there may be cars driving in the opposite direction than you.</p>
						<p>If you plan to take the shuttle, walk to the pick up point in the Washington Lane train station parking lot (there will be a sign). The van will be doing a continuous loop, so if it's not there, just hang tight for a few minutes.</p> 
						<p>Either way, let's all cross our fingers for good weather.  If that doesn't work and it's rainy, don't forget to bring your umbrellas and dress comfortably!</p>
