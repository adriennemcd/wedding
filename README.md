## Introduction

This is the wedding site that I'm designing and building for me and my fiance Mike.  It's built on _Skeletor_, a directory structure and Gruntfile designed as an easy starting point for front end development of projects. Mainly it was developed for projects at Delphic Digital, but it was designed to be agnostic, so any project is capable of using it. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing web apps with best practices in mind.

See the [docs](doc/TOC.md) to learn more about using Skeletor.
